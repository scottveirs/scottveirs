### My Opensource Story
I am on a steep learning curve -- as a project manager, sometimes-creative, and wannabe-developer -- helping guide the amazing Orcasound open source design and development community towards successful conservation of soniferous marine life, starting with endangered orcas (aka Southern Resident killer whales).

  
### Credits
- Thanks to [gautamkrishnar](https://github.com/gautamkrishnar) for much of this README, and the `Latest Blog Posts` section. For years I've longed for a way to automagically keep a list my blog posts up to date -- no matter where and what I write.
